# Why I Haven't Uploaded Anything in the Last 2 Years

It's been over two years since I last uploaded anything to my GitHub, and I want to take a moment to explain why. In the time since, my journey has taken me into new and exciting directions that have shaped my current path as a developer and entrepreneur.

Two years ago, I was deeply involved in FiveM scripting, creating custom scripts for servers and working on various projects within the gaming community. However, over time, my interests evolved, and I found myself drawn to the rapidly growing field of **blockchain technology**.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve focused heavily on **blockchain**, **cryptography**, and **startup development**. I dove into building decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, honing my skills in **Rust** and **Solidity**, and gaining valuable experience in **blockchain security**. This shift also involved exploring new areas like cryptography, secure coding practices, and penetration testing. These subjects became my new passion, and they opened doors to a variety of exciting opportunities.

In addition to technical growth, I’ve been fortunate to help launch and grow several **startups**, working closely with founders to bring their ideas to life and achieve success. Through my work with startups, I’ve developed a deeper understanding of what it takes to build a successful business from the ground up, navigating challenges, building scalable solutions, and refining strategies for growth.

While my GitHub activity may have slowed down during this period of transition, I’ve been involved in many hands-on projects and have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience that I’m excited to share with the world moving forward. I’m now ready to return to the open-source community with fresh insights, new technologies, and a renewed passion for creating impactful projects.

I’m looking forward to contributing again to GitHub, focusing on blockchain development, cybersecurity, and helping shape the future of innovative projects.
